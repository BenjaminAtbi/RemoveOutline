# Remove Outline from Party in Highlight View

In the vanilla game, when you activate highlight view, members of your party are surrounded by a green outline. This mod removes that green outline.

The main utility of the mod comes when combined with the Toybox option to activate highlight view as a toggle rather than a held button. I like to keep highlight toggled on through the entire game, but the permanent green outline was ugly and distracting.
